## Description
The **Student Data Management System** is a web-based application developed using Java, JSP, Servlets, and PostgreSQL.

Users can add new students, update existing records, and delete students from the database. The project provides a user-friendly interface for easy management and ensures data validation and integrity.

## Features

- **Update Student Records**: Modify existing student data.
- **Delete Student Records**: Remove student records from the database.
